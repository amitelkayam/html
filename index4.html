<h1> An accessible observation corner next to the Hilton Hotel Tel Aviv </h1>
<p> If you happen to be in Tel Aviv and you have free time, we strongly recommend that you park your car in the parking lot of the Hilton Hotel (there are disabled parking spaces) and go up an asphalt paved path accessible from the left (south) of the hotel to an observation deck on the beach of Tel Aviv and the marina.
The view is stunning and the access is easy. Also suitable for the disabled - there are 4 benches. </p>

<h2> Neot Kedumim Reserve </h2>
<p> This route is aimed at the population who need an easy, accessible road, which allows for comfortable walking and the use of carts of all kinds. This route has rest stops for rest and a support rail along its entire length.
In short sections of the route there are slopes that require the assistance of an escort.<br></br>
On the track -
Between the perfume beds and the vineyards there is a walk following the descriptions of nature and a tour of the Menorah hill between olive groves and oil facilities.
The visitor is given a 'route page' along which you can see some of the ancient landscapes of Neot that represent the landscapes of the country, the crops of the seven species as well as agricultural installations. These illustrate the course of life in those days, as they are reflected in the Bible and other Jewish sources. In addition, a water cistern is located on the route.<br></br>
The guideline of the park is to present the vegetation, nature and agriculture of the Land of Israel as it was in biblical times. Along with typical plant species planted in the reserve and a number of small ponds, it also includes restorations of a winepress, cloth house and other ancient buildings.

Neot Kedumim allows for many activities within its framework. In all seasons of the year, the park hosts activities for the general public, the business and educational sectors. The park offers tours for schools, other organized groups, families and individuals.

The park operates the Leadership Center which holds experiential workshops in nature in light of the resources on leadership and team development. Every year, hundreds of groups belonging to the business, public, educational and military sectors visit the Leadership Center.<br></br>

<h3> The estuary of Nahal Sorek and Palmachim Beach </h3>
<p>Nahal Sorek is one of the largest streams in the center of the country, and is about 70 km long. It begins at the entrances to Ramallah, and on its long way to the sea it passes on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh, Gedera and Yavneh. Clean, and today sewage water that has undergone purification (effluent) flows here, but even after the treatment it is not fit for drinking but only to be waded in.
Nahal Sorek estuary national park combines all the elements for an easy hike for the whole family, it is a river that can be walked to its banks, animals that live in the place, soft sea sands and a spectacular view from a cliff overlooking the sea.<br></br>
Instead of signs that mark the walking routes that are suitable for families and are of easy difficulty. There are about three routes, which last about half an hour to two and a half hours - depending on the route, and they are all circular whose starting and ending point is in the paratroopers' grove, near the Nahal Sorek bridge, on the side of the road leading to Kibbutz Palmachim.<br></br>
How to get to the reserve?
On Road 4311, drive to the Paratroopers' Grove (for those coming from the northeast, it will be on your left) continue a little straight and a square will allow you to retrace your steps and enter the grove. Coming from the southwest - just take the same road and turn right. In any case, both the paratroopers' grove and the Nahal Sorek estuary reserve appear in Wise. From the woods you can reach the reserve on a path that passes under the road.
Accessibility - There is accessibility for carts in the first half kilometer but further down the route towards the beach it will be difficult with the carts because of the sand.<br></br>
In Kibbutz Palmachim you will find a fun and instructive museum called Beit Miriam, which deals with the archeology and history of the area. The important archaeological find in the museum is a letter on pottery in ancient Hebrew script. Also on site: nature tours to get to know the vegetation, first hut, display of objects from the beginning of Kibbutz Palmachim and a mosaic floor. Highly recommended to visit the place. The museum is open for visits by prior arrangement most days of the week, and sometimes also on weekends (especially for groups) | To arrange a visit to the museum: 073-7823388. </p>
