<h1> Accessible tour of the Sharon: Pelicans at an expensive lookout point 
Expensive lookout point in the Mishmar Hasharon reservoir  </h1>
<p> Suitable for seasons: autumn, winter, spring.
Duration of the trip: about an hour depending on the level of interest.

From the parking lot, a wide, moderately sloping road leads to the lookout point between the lawn and the ornamental garden. The lookout is a large shaded balcony above the Mishmar Hasharon reservoir built by the JNF. The reservoir absorbs the floodwaters in the Alexander River.<br></br>
The large number of pelicans that spend time in the reservoir is not accidental. The common pelican population, which nests in Europe, numbers more than 30,000 individuals. This population migrates mostly and winters in Africa. All migratory individuals of this population pass through Israel during the migration seasons, mainly between September and November and between March and May. In recent years, several hundred pelicans have remained "wintering" in Israel.<br></br>
Accessibility adjustments for visitors with disabilities:
Disabled parking: There is no disabled parking in the parking lot.
Degree of difficulty: a marked path with a moderate slope.
Rest and picnic: In the lookout, 2 benches, without armrests, are built around pillars that support shading. In Tal Park next to the lookout point, picnic tables. There are no wheelchair-friendly picnic systems. The park is not wheelchair accessible.
