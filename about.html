<font  face="ARIAL" color="red" size="16" >  A little about me </font>
<p><font size="5"><i>Well if you came here, I'll tell you a little about myself and also why this world is important to me. In my 20s, I underwent ankle surgery on my left leg.<br></br>
A surgery that changed my life. Yes yes ... (I did not drama too much) After the operation I needed rehabilitation that lasted a total of about a year.<br></br>
My surgery was performed during the military. I was hospitalized at Ichilov Hospital ... After 3 days in the ward, I moved to a general rehabilitation that lasted about two and a half months.<br></br>
The military decided to release me from his shelter and I actually switched to civilian medical treatments. When I was released from the hospital, my condition was that I could move around with crutches inside the house, but for walking outside I needed a wheelchair.<br></br>
One day my mother and I went for a walk.
We wanted to go to the city promenade from where there is a stunning view of the sea (I really like the sea) After arriving in the area, we wanted to go to the theater amphitheater open to the public (secret there is a stunning view of the sea) we encountered no accessibility for people with disabilities.<br> </br>
I was very sad, although you can see the sea from other places and the scenery is very beautiful, but I really wanted to be there.
That day I felt a little limited even though on the inside I did not feel limited.
And I said to myself why are I being restricted? And full of others like me? Although for me it is temporary but what will people with permanent disabilities do?<br></br>
So I set up this site to both flood my story and that of another full of other people
Hope I can succeed Thanks for reading ...
And is a few pictures for acquaintance</i></font></p>
