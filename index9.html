<h3> Masada National Park </h3>
<p> Above the Dead Sea, on the summit of an isolated cliff, lies Masada Fortress. The fortress became a symbol of Jewish determination in the face of foreign Roman rule.
Masada Fortress was built by King Herod in 37 to 31 BC in case his Jewish subjects revolted. In 66 AD, with the outbreak of the Jewish revolt against Rome, a group of zealots led by Elazar ben Yair conquered the fortress. The group engaged in raids and harassment of communities in the area. When the Romans entered Masada, they discovered that 1000 of his defenders had chosen to set the fort on fire and commit suicide. The suicide story of the defenders of Masada has become a myth, although there are still many controversial details in the story.<br></br>
