<h1> the old City in Jerusalem </h1>
<p> The Old City is a fertile tourist area but one of the difficulties described by residents and tourists alike is the difficulty of getting around in the Old City, even with prams and even more so with wheelchairs. Even a person with a slight mobility impairment will have difficulty walking around for long hours climbing many stairs and walking the magical alleys while having to lean back and look for a railing.<br></br>
In 2014, a revolutionary project began in the Old City, the first of its kind in the world with the entire goal of making the Old City accessible to people with reduced mobility. During the project, emphasis was placed on upgrading the flooring and building ramps parallel to the many stairs, the many awnings scattered throughout the city were renewed to create a uniform look, handrails were installed along the walls for support, facades were painted, directional signs were placed next to main sites. Many, upgraded the regular cleaning and garbage collection system, highlighted historical or archeological finds of public interest, removed safety hazards, the lighting was taken care of, fences were installed to prevent falls and sidewalks were upgraded to make walking easier. At the same time, the public services were renovated and made accessible to the disabled.<br></br>
Another change that has taken place in the city is the accessibility of the road for people sitting in wheelchairs -
Today you can get to the Old City via the free "Free to the Old City" shuttle, which departs from the station complex to the Garbage Gate and returns on a daily basis, every 20 minutes, and once an hour an accessible wheelchair shuttle departs. Parking in the complex is on a daily rate (approximately NIS 17 per full day).


In addition, you are also invited to download free guided audio tours on accessible routes in the "Voice Tours in the Old City" app (on the routes: the Jewish Quarter, Via Dolorosa, the Temple Mount, from Jaffa Gate to Zion Gate). </p>

<h2> Stalactite cave </h2>
<p> The Stalactite Cave is a karst cave located on the western edge of the Judean Mountains. The stalactites in the cave were formed about 5 million years ago following the encounter of water with carbon dioxide.
The Nature and Parks Authority has invested in the field of lighting and created a colorful and special look for the cave while preserving ecology to prevent damage to the cave. In addition to the ecological aspect, as part of the works to upgrade the cave, the railings along the path were also replaced, and work was carried out that improves accessibility for the disabled. Handholds were also installed, built-in elements, such as benches and railings, were emphasized, and the lighting along the path and in the foyer was adjusted.<br></br>
The site has been accessible to disabled and disabled visitors for about a decade, including access to the cave, improved access roads for the disabled, disabled services installed, and two leaflets installed to lower the cave level as well as an observation post.<br></br>
For all those who visit and want to touch the stalactites and stalagmites - know that this is forbidden, both for fear of breaking but also because of the transfer of the natural fat in their hands to the stalactites - which will hurt their further creation,
However, prepare for yourself at the entrance to the cave a petting zoo, or "petting zoo" as the webmasters call it, where some real examples of tactile stalactites are constantly.<br></br>
