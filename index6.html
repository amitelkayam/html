<h1> The spaces of Telem springs </h1>
<p>On the western slopes of the Judean Mountains is the Cedars Valley Park, which together with Nahal Tzofim, Emek Motza and Nahal Refaim is called "Jerusalem Park". The park, which covers about 15,000 dunams, was established to serve as a leisure and recreation area for the city's residents, as well as to preserve the environmental and heritage values ​​of the Jerusalem mountains.
The park section of the Cedars Valley is located between the exit roundabout and the Golda Meir interchange, and in the center passes the channel of Nahal Sorek.
The large spaces of the park are ecological habitats and corridors for a wide variety of animals, including herds of deer, families of rock rabbits as well as hyenas and foxes. The park also has a large variety of songbirds, day predators and night predators.<br></br>
Within the Cedar Valley there is a route to the furrows, which are a group of small springs that spring between the rock layers. The route is an accessible path that also serves as a bicycle path, which passes under the new bridge of the high-speed train line from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and from there you can see the monument commemorating the Twin Towers disaster.
On the side of the path you can see the remains of the agricultural settlement of Beit Talma from the beginning of the 20th century. Nearby there is an orchard with picnic tables and a stone childhood playground.<br></br>
The path is about three kilometers long, and there are modern playgrounds with rope facilities. For those coming from the direction of Tel Aviv on Road 1, the exit at the Motza-Moshav Beit Zayit interchange. Continue about 400 meters north parallel to Road 1. Cross north under Road 1 and turn right at the exit of the tunnel to Einot Telem. The parking lot at the mouth of Nahal Khalilim is about 500 meters up the valley. Admission is free.
For those coming from Golda Boulevard, 50 meters before turning onto Begin Road South, turn right into Cedar Valley Park and take the road to Einot Telem parking lot. </p>
